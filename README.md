What's good bro? So in order to access this Reason file you will need to download the .zip from github and decompress it. It works better if the destination folder is not the same/a child of the zip folder.
Next, download 7zip from the internet. 7zip is the shit and it comes on all platforms. Open the 7zip file manager, navigate to the unzipped folder, right-click the file ending with .001, and select combine files. The result should be a finished Reason file. I hope it all works out! If it doesn't, please do not
hesitate to hit me up!
