What's good bro? So in order to access this Reason file you will need to download the .zip and 
decompress it. It works better if the destination folder is not the same/a child of the zip folder.
Next, download 7zip from the internet. 7zip is the shit and it comes on all platforms. Finally, right-
click the file ending with .001 and select combine files. I hope it all works out, if it doesn't do not
hesitate to hit me up!
